1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset 
	- KDD-CUP dataset
	- BOT-IOT dataset
3. Data processing
	- Pandas Dataframe
	- Keras tensor
	- Cleaning rthe datset
4. Visualization using seaborn & matplotlib
5. Label Encoding using LabelEncoder
6. Feature Selection 
	- RFE - processed two times to reduce the dataset columns size
7. Splitting the data to train and test for Deep LEarning and Taking X and Y for Machine Learning
8. Building the model

	
	
	- Random Forest
	- Decision Tree
	- Support Vector Machine
	- Naive Bayes
	- Voting Classifier -(RF + AdaBoost)
	- Stacking Classifier - (RF + MLP with LightGBM)
	- DL
	- LSTM

	 
 
9. Training and Building the model


Flask Framework
----------------

 
10. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
11. Importing the packages
12. User gives input as Feature Values 
13. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
14. Trained model is used for prediction
15. Final outcome is displayed through frontend


Extension
----------

In the base paper the author mentioned to use differ sampling and encoding techinque for analysis the dataset with Machine learning models like RF, DT, SVM,NB
As an extension we applied ensemble method  combine the predictions of multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate final prediction.
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other ensemble techniques such as Voting Classifier combination of RF + ADaBoost and 
Stacking Classifier with RF + MLP with LightGBM
As an extension we can build front end using flask framework for user testing and with user authenication.
